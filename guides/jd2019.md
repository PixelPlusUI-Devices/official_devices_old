### Prerequisites

- Unlocked bootloader (Reference video can be found [here](https://youtu.be/cWGEDpvWK0A))

    * [FirmwareR2Updater](https://sourceforge.net/projects/z5s-roms/files/Firmware/FirmwareR2Updater.zip/download)
- And of course the ROM itself

## Clean Flash

NOTE: If you are coming from PixelPlusUI v3.1 or other ROMs, you are required to clean flash to prevent bugs. And if you are coming from PixelPlusUI v3.8 or any non-OSS build, you are required to clean flash when you are switching from ZUI Vendor to OSS Vendor, and vice versa. Also take note that clean flash will erase everything inside your storage.
