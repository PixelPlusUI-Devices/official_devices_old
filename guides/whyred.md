# Installation Guide For PixelPlusUI on The Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro (Whyred)

### CLEAN FLASH (RECOMMENDED) : 
1. First take a backup then wipe cache, dalvik/ART cache, System, Vendor and Data
2. Flash the latest Firmware (always recommended) (Can ignore this step if done once already)
3. Flash the ROM
4. Flash Migrate backup/Swift Backup to if you want to restore backup data (or any method you use to backup)
5. Flash Magisk (Optional) (if you want to root your device) 
6. Reboot

### DIRTY FLASH IF AN UPDATE
1. Clear Dalvik and Cache 
2. Flash ROM
3. Flash Magisk (Optional) (if you want to root your device) 
4. Reboot

OR 

Go to Settings -> System Update -> Update through OTA! 

### Coming from Stock MIUI? Follow This! 
1. First take a backup then FORMAT DATA -> Swipe to format Data
2. Wipe cache, dalvik/ART cache, System, Vendor and Data
3. Flash the ROM
4. Flash Magisk (Optional) (if you want to root your device) 

### Want to Flash A12 from A11?
1. Take A Backup before updating (This step can be skipped but always Recommended from my side)
2. Follow the Same Procedure as Clean Flash but make sure to remove SD Cards if any else you won't be able to come back to recovery!
## NOTE - Do NOT Update TO Android 12 If SD Card is essenial for you! I will update the guide once SD Card issue is Fixed!  

## Note: 
• Before changing default kernel, make sure to take a backup of the existing kernel (boot.img) and then flash the custom kernel of your choice, you can click [Here](https://t.me/modulesrepo/1606) to check the list of custom kernels available for Whyred
• Do Flash Magisk again (if previously rooted) to get root access again
